            "body": "<p>Remember when the Internet was supposed to kill off television?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>That hasn\u2019t been the case lately, judging by the record television ratings for big-ticket events. The Vancouver Olympics are shaping up to be the most-watched foreign Winter Games since 1994. This year\u2019s Super Bowl was the most-watched program in United States history, beating out the final episode of \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d in 1983. Awards shows like the Grammys are attracting their biggest audiences in years.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>The story</h3>\r\n<p>Many television executives are crediting the Internet, in part, for the revival.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Blogs and social Web sites like Facebook and Twitter enable an online water-cooler conversation, encouraging people to split their time between the computer screen and the big-screen TV.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Nielsen Company, which measures television viewership and Web traffic, noticed this month that one in seven people who were watching the Super Bowl and the Olympics opening ceremony were surfing the Web at the same time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\u201cThe Internet is our friend, not our enemy,\u201d said Leslie Moonves, chief executive of the CBS Corporation, which broadcast both the Super Bowl and the Grammy Awards this year. \u201cPeople want to be attached to each other.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Seeking to capitalize on the online water-cooler effect, NBC showed the Golden Globes live on both coasts for the first time this year, and the network reportedly wants to do the same for the Emmy Awards this fall, so the entire country can watch (and chat online) simultaneously.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>But sometimes the effect works even when the program is not live. Rachel Velonza, a 23-year-old from Seattle, knew that Johnny Weir failed to win a medal in figure skating long before she ever turned on a television last Thursday, but she stayed up until almost midnight, enduring NBC\u2019s much-ridiculed tape delay because she wanted to see for herself why he wound up in sixth place. She knew all her friends were watching because they were talking about it on Twitter (which says it counts 50 million posts every day) and Facebook (which says it surpassed 400 million members this month).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\u201cEven though knowing ahead spoils the program, you just can\u2019t help but see for yourself what all these people are talking about,\u201d she said.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>The other crowd</h3>\r\n<p>NBC says it thinks the habits of people like Ms. Velonza partly explain why the ratings for the Olympics are up noticeably.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\u201cPeople want to have something to share,\u201d Alan Wurtzel, the head of research for NBC Universal, said from Vancouver. He said the effects of online conversations were \u201cimportant for all big event programming, and also, honestly, for all of television going forward.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If viewers cannot be in the same room, the next best thing is a chat room or something like it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>That\u2019s what MTV found last fall during the Video Music Awards: the Twitterati were in a tizzy when Kanye West snatched a microphone from Taylor Swift in the middle of her acceptance speech. The show had an average of nine million viewers, its best performance in six years.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Recording Academy, which presents the Grammys, mounted a digital campaign to promote the awards show this year, signing up Facebook fans and monitoring Grammy-related Twitter messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Peter Anton, the academy\u2019s vice president for digital media, said it was not a coincidence that the awards show notched a 35 percent gain over last year\u2019s audience totals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Watching the Olympics, Della Lee, a disabled mother of twins in Springfield, Ore., found herself joking on Twitter about curling with dozens of fellow viewers, and was much more deeply engaged in the broadcast as a result. \u201cI really got into curling yesterday! It\u2019s a fun sport,\u201d she wrote to a friend later.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Beyond the boob tube</h3>\r\n<p>The effect is obviously not limited to television. Online conversations can also help or hinder opening weekends for movies and the ratings for politicians. Recent studies of online social networks have affirmed what researchers have long recognized: people seek to be around and be influenced by like-minded individuals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>There are other factors contributing to the ratings spikes: attention-grabbing shows (the Super Bowl featured the New Orleans Saints, a popular underdog), gradual population growth and an economic contraction that some analysts say is leading to more people spending more time at home in front of their TV and computer screens.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Along with those reasons, \u201cincreased usage of social media is definitely driving the ratings,\u201d said Jon Gibs, a vice president at Nielsen. He said the Olympic data showing simultaneous TV-and-Web viewing signaled the growing importance of interactivity to the television experience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Some of the marquee Olympic events are tape-delayed this month, even though Olympic results are instantly available on the Web. But people are still watching the Games in prime time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Brad Peterson, a lighting designer in New York, heard about the skier Lindsey Vonn\u2019s crash before Thursday\u2019s replay of it on NBC, but watched regardless. After all, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know when, how and who won.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For Mr. Wurtzel, the Olympics are a lab, and so far he said he has found that people who follow the Olympics both on TV and online wind up being heavier viewers of television.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Media companies are starting to consider how to incorporate that water-cooler effect \u2014 and how to harness it for day-to-day TV shows, too. For the Olympics, NBC is promoting something called \u201cYou Be the Judge,\u201d which lets viewers submit their own scores for figure skaters through a Web application and compare their scores to other viewers. The network\u2019s Web site also features a gadget that tracks Twitter opinions about the Games.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Chloe Sladden, director of media partnerships for Twitter, said sites like Twitter let people feel plugged in to a real-time conversation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\u201cIn the future, I can\u2019t imagine a major event where the audience doesn\u2019t become part of the story itself,\u201d Ms. Sladden said.</p>",
